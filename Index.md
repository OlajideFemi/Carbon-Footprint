# Carbon Footprint Data Analysis

Welcome to my Carbon Footprint Data Analysis GitHub Page! Here, I explore how Data Analytics is making a difference in Decarbonization and Emission Reduction. This project aims to present a data-driven approach to analyzing carbon emissions. It includes time series forecasting with GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models, as well as geographical data analysis and community detection using network analysis methods.

There is an old saying that a problem well-defined is already half solved. Hence, I'll start by cleaning the data and simply graphing it to visually observe the nature of the underlying pattern.

The evidence is clear: the time for action is now. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), halving emissions by 2030 is imperative to address climate change effectively. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report Working Group III (AR6 WGIII) emphasizes the urgency of this goal.

For more information, please refer to the IPCC's press release dated April 4, 2022, available at: [https://www.ipcc.ch/2022/04/04/ipcc-ar6-wgiii-pressrelease/](https://www.ipcc.ch/2022/04/04/ipcc-ar6-wgiii-pressrelease/)

## Quick Start

Get up and running with Carbon footprint analysis in just a few steps:

1. Step one: load the dataset into a pandas dataframe
2. Step two: Clean the date, filter out duplicates
3. Step three: Implement the various algorithms

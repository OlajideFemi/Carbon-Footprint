# Carbon Footprint data Analysis

Welcome to the Carbon footprint Data Analysis GitHub Page! Here, I dive deep into how Data Analytics is making a difference in the field of De-carbonization and Emissions reduction. This project aims to present a data driven approach on carbon emissions within the United kingdom that involves time series forecasting with 
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models, and possibly some geographical data analysis and community detection using network analysis methods.

The PSA scheme opened on 16 November and is likely to run until March 2022. The scheme provides processers the opportunity to place pork products in frozen storage for a period of between 2-6 months.

With the introduction of the SIP scheme, processors can receive a payment of £3 per pig for any pig slaughtered in additional shifts put on by a slaughterhouse. To be eligible for the scheme, shifts must be additional to those already agreed with the Food Standards Agency and be dedicated to the SIP scheme.  Additionally, the meat must be cut into 6 bone-in cuts per carcase (2 x legs, 2 x middles, 2 x shoulders) and either be put into the Private Storage Aid scheme in England or exported.

The Global Synthetics Monitoring: Analysis, Reporting and Trends (SMART) programme operates the UNODC Early Warning Advisory on New Psychoactive Substances (EWA) and builds capacity on early warning, synthetic drugs and new psychoactive substances at the national level in the framework of the UNODC Synthetic Drug Strategy 2021-2025. This particular project seeks funding for complementary activities to the EWA which will be to build capacity of national institutions to contribute to and strengthen forensic early warning systems.
 
The outcome of this project is for forensic laboratories in four countries in Central America to better analyse information on emerging synthetic drug threats and contribute more effectively to early warning mechanisms at the national and international level, thereby enabling governments to develope responses earlier.   

The activities will be implemented by the Regional SMART Coordinator based in El Salvador in collaboration with a scientific expert based at UNODC Headquarters in Austria. The implementation modalities will include technical advisory missions, provision of technical advice via videoconferences and email, and through a regional capacity building workshop in El Salvador for four beneficiary countries (El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras).",50000.00,2022-04-01,2024-03-31,General Grant - Uncompeted,24,Public order and safety,Criminal Justice Act 1993

We know that YWG are increasingly involved in county lines, serious violence, and gang activity. Feedback from the YPA organisations tells us that they are now dealing with far more harm types and vulnerabilities including child sexual abuse, peer on peer abuse, and online grooming. The way in which the Home Office approaches vulnerability has also changed. We are implementing a cross-cutting approach to addressing vulnerability and risk factors more broadly across Public Safety Group, and moving away from a siloed, harm-specific approach. As such, we propose a broad ranging fund which will enable advocates to provide tailored support to those vulnerable YWG experiencing or at risk of gang involvement and associated sexual or criminal exploitation, county lines and serious violence. The key objectives of this newfund will be 1) to reduce crime and protect victims through providing tailored support to gang affected YWGs aged under 25 at risk of or experiencing harm, including both preventative services and access to victims services where appropriate and 2)to raise awareness and dispel stereotypes amongst frontline professionals, services and the local community about gang related harm in YWG, including how to spot the signs and support the YWG involved.",643236.00,2022-04-01,2025-03-31,General Grant - Competed,36,Public order and safety,"Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004"

The core objectives of this project are to:

a) Establish at least four pilot study locations with local partners to implement Nature-based Solutions for carbon storage and sequestration which will act as test beds to fill evidence gaps in our understanding of carbon storage and sequestration by semi-natural habitats.  Two of these locations will be Landscape Recovery pilots under Defras environmental land management scheme and two will be new pilot studies selected for this project.
b) Work with Defras Landscape Recovery Team, Defra Green Finance and other internal and external stakeholders to demonstrate and test appropriate governance models for delivering NbS at the landscape scale, including  building our understanding who the ideal catchment system operator should be and the legal and financial structures that are required. We will also consider appropriate methodologies for targeting NbS interventions to maximise efficiency, environmental outcomes and value for money.
c) Undertake robust monitoring and evaluation of the carbon stored and sequestered by NbS interventions, drawing both on existing habitats created or restored over a range of time intervals and establishing baseline monitoring for newly created habitats that can be monitored beyond the lifetime of the project. 
d) Undertake mm-scale, high-resolution measuring, mapping and modelling of above and below ground biodiversity and its influence on carbon stocks and flows within multiple habitats. This will generate comprehensive baseline data and close evidence gaps on the relationship between landscape function and carbon sequestration. This work will be focussed on Kews research site at Wakehurst but Kew scientific research methodology will be sharable and scalable, creating a rigorous baseline for the benefit of NbS at our pilot sites and beyond.
e) Analyse and assess collected data to inform decision making, and assessment of efficacy of NbS interventions for climate change.
f) Undertake research into the biodiversity and social benefits associated with NbS for climate change at the landscape scale to further understand the additional benefits such as job creation, health and access to green spaces.
g) Develop a toolkit of resources covering   governance, mapping and targeting, and data and evidence needs for developing landscape scale NbS projects that can be used by internal and external stakeholders. 
h) Provide the basis for development of environmental markets, and identify potential revenue streams and models that  could eventually be used to fund on-going maintenance or monitoring of the implemented NbS.
i) Demonstrate the benefit of a collaborative platform approach for managing and funding the implementation of NbS at the landscape scale.",2500000.00,2022-04-01,2024-03-31,General Grant - Competed,24,Environmental protection,Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006

Ministry of Defence,Ministry of Defence,G2-SCH-2022-08-11587,Engineering Pathway (MSSC),"The MSSC Marine Engineering Pathway (MEP) is a national Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) initiative, providing workshops to 10000 young people a year in schools across the UK.  It gives young people a more practical understanding of the world of marine engineering and highlights key issues such as climate change, career opportunities and more.

The workshops involve hands-on exercises and experiments which allow children to learn in a different way to the standard classroom environment. They cover issues that marine engineers can help to resolve, including rising sea levels, pollution to oceans and rivers, and pollution from shipping. These issues not only apply national curriculum topics to real-life situations but are linked to specific UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Governments Maritime 2050 strategy.

MEP has proven successful - over 96% of the teachers surveyed said they would recommend the workshop to other schools, and students have described the sessions as exciting and unique.  The MEP workshops support the PSHE and science curricula for England, Wales and Scotland and are aimed at pupils in KS3.

The workshop focusses on buoyancy, exploring some of the scientific principles behind displacement, density, Newtons 3rd Law and Archimedes Principle. In teams, pupils are tasked with designing and building a ship which is stable in the water while carrying as much cargo as possible. This practical task concludes in the pupils testing their ships and discovering which team has succeeded in carrying the most cargo whilst staying afloat!

MEP runs on donations and costs £300,000 a year. Sea Cadets target for 2022 is to engage a further 15,000 children through MEP sessions, to inspire children to become the next generation of marine engineers.

The MOD will provide the MSSC with £20000 (VAT inclusive) as a financial sponsorship contribution to support the delivery of the MEP.  

The MSSC MEP aligns with the aim of the RN STEM Engagement Strategy to bring coherence to the STEM engagement that is carried out across the RN to maximise its impact.  In bringing coherence to the approach, the MEP will exploit the STEM benefits across both the MSSC and the RN STEM Engagement Strategy, thereby increasing the pool of STEM talented and motivated individuals from which the RN can recruit.  Additionally, MSSC and RN engagement in STEM activity is vital to stimulate interest in the wider Defence Naval Sector as both the MSSC and the RN seek to support the development of the skills required in young people, teachers, and parents.  It will signpost the importance of STEM subjects and STEM-related careers as a worthwhile pathway to fulfilling employment.",20000.00,2021-04-01,2023-03-31,General Grant - Uncompeted,24,Defence,Appropriation Act

The aim is to establish and roll out a national model of best-practice for using RJ in a retail context. Restorative Justice is not currently used routinely in retail settings because Police Officers are often unclear about how to deploy a restorative victim-led response, lack of knowledge by retail victims and managers about how to access it and a lack of well-established referral routes. There is a strong body of evidence indicating how restorative approaches can support victims whilst also supporting a reduction in reoffending and making our streets and shops safer places to live. The pilot is intended to have a positive impact on retail workers, businesses and policing.

Over the past 8 years the EEF has provided £72m of grant funding to 156 companies, leveraging between £100m and £209m in private investment as a direct result of the programme.

Department of Health and Social Care,NHS England,G2-SCH-2022-11-12176,The Hub of Hope mental health crisis support,"The NHS Long Term Plan makes a renewed commitment to improve and widen access to care for children and adults needing mental health support. Before and during the pandemic, positive progress has been made on the expansion of adult crisis and liaison services such as the opening of 24/7 urgent mental health helpline, improvement of crisis alternative support such as crisis cafés, safe havens etc. However, the pandemic also has increased immense pressure on mental health services overall and therefore, it increased the acuity need and number of presentations to crisis and acute services. More people are looking for mental health services and the demand for signposting them to the right services remains an essential task. A&E pressures and particularly waiting times are higher than ever (30-40k MH attendances to ED each month, ~13% of MH patients now waiting above 12hrs), and the Hub of Hope is one of a number of alternative sources of support that we believe is likely to help diverting demand away from 111 / A&E. 


Developed by the charity Chasing the Stigma (CTS) the Hub of Hope (HoH) digital platform is a mental health signposting tool (website and mobile app) that is now the biggest and most comprehensive publicly available database of local mental health support. It has particular value in bringing together non-statutory services such as peer support groups that are highly valued by people, but are not held in a directory anywhere else. It is particularly unique as it has been developed from a lived experience perspective and therefore designed intuitively for people who may be feeling suicidal and seeking to know that there is support available and what type of support is likely to be most helpful  a perspective that statutory bodies have traditionally failed to do well. 

Using a postcode search, web browsers or mobile devices location, the free app and website can pinpoint the nearest, local mental services anywhere in the UK, within both the NHS and across the third sector. 

The app also lists alternative resource to support people experiencing a mental health crisis, including a direct link to the Samaritans as well as a new, 24/7 crisis text service in partnership with Crisis Text Line, among other national bodies.  All local NHS mental health crisis lines are also included prominently.  

CTS has made major strides in filling a gap in the sector that had not been achieved by any major statutory or other mental health organisation.",156900.00,2022-04-01,2025-03-31,General Grant - Uncompeted,36,Health,NHS Act 2006
Department of Health and Social Care,NHS England,G2-SCH-2022-11-12178,London Sexual Violence Grants Programme 2022,"In 2018/19 NHS England made an additional £4million per annum available nationally to support the implementation of the Strategic Direction for Sexual Assault and Abuse Services  Lifelong care for victims and survivors: 2018 - 2023. Of this a recurrent annual sum was made available to London. 

NHS England (London) is initiating a Sexual Violence grants programme to manage the disbursement of these funds. It is offering funding specifically for the voluntary sector up until 31st March 2025.

The intention of this grant is to meet the core priorities as set out in the SAAS Strategy through a variety of services offered in the voluntary sector and its resulting health, wellbeing and potential criminal justice outcomes for victims and survivors of abuse and assault, as well as broader workforce training and awareness raising in other services and sectors. 

Based on previous experience we anticipate awarding four to five grant recipients with the maximum grant available per organisation or partnership capped at £450,000 p/a with other successful bidders awarded thereafter based on the evaluation methodology. Each grant proposal will need to set out in their application how they intend to respond to three of the cross-cutting core priorities plus one other, what the geographical coverage will be and what outcomes will be achieved. 

The core priorities are as follows:
National priority 1: Strengthening the approach to prevention
National priority 2: Promoting safeguarding and the safety, protection and welfare of victims and survivors
National priority 3: Involving victims and survivors in the development and improvement of service
National priority 4: Introducing consistent quality standards
National priority 5: Driving collaboration and reducing fragmentation
National priority 6: Ensuring an appropriately trained workforce

Outcomes 
These resources are to be used as a contribution to support the overall delivery of NHS Englands strategic direction for sexual assault and abuse services, and in this context influence the wider health systems response to sexual violence. The funding is not being used to deliver NHS Englands specific commissioning responsibilities such as those related to Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs). 

The bidders will be required to identify outcomes in their application that meet the SAAS Core Priorities. 

We expect the general high-level outcomes to be achieved in London for the sexual violence sector:

- More victims of sexual violence to report incidents of abuse
- Reductions in repeat victimisation
- Victims supported to cope and recover
- Improved health and wellbeing 
- Improved access and experience of mainstream health services
- Increasing links between the Havens (Londons Sexual Assault Referral Centre) and wider community services
- Increased access to the criminal justice services
- Reduction in the rates of attrition in cases as they progress through the criminal justice process
- Improved victim satisfaction in criminal justice & health & well-being services
- Survivors have increased access to other required services.
- The long-term impact of sexual violence is reduced.

3. Data from the Cancer Care Map is available to support service providers and alliances in understanding user journeys and service needs. 


Outcomes: 
Increased numbers of people affected by cancer (including friends and family) and health care teams will get easier and quicker access to up to date information on services to support them, enabling people to recover more quickly from cancer treatment, and to cope better with the long term impacts of cancer and its treatment, including physical, social and psychological.

This will be achieved through harnessing the strengths of nationwide coverage, enhanced by specific intelligence from local systems.
Whilst some local areas have developed nRTSSS systems, they have different operational priorities and there is no current nationwide system.  A nationwide nRTSSS system would allow us to significantly reduce the time that currently exists between the date of a death and reporting through the existing ONS registered deaths by suicide data releases.
If robust data can be collected close to real time, it will provide an effective early warning system to support the ambition of reducing suicide in England by: 
1. Assessing and reporting any overall change in rates and the impact on population groups (e.g., by ethnicity, geography, and economic deprivation). 
2. Identifying emerging clusters and changes in methods.

development of an alternative child protection pathway in instances where 
the primary threat to children comes from outside, rather than within, the 
home. Wiltshire have already piloted such an approach through their Risk 
Outside the Home (ROTH) pathway. While the early findings from 
Wiltshire's pilot were positive, the complexities and small numbers of 
children involved to date means there is a strong case to further test this 
approach. Durham University, as part of their Planning for Safety project, is 
seeking to further test the ROTH pathway in 4 local authorities (Wiltshire,
plus an additional 3 LAs). DfE will be contributing funding to this project 
(November 2022 to March 2023) to help LAs with set up costs and are 
commissioning Durham University to capture the findings from the project in 
a learning report. The learning report will further our understanding of how 
the ROTH pathway is implemented, provide an indication of whether it is 
likely to improve the response to extra-familial harm and set out any
potential implications for government to consider as they pursue reforms in 
this area.
This grant agreement covers funded activities to be carried out by Durham 
University to capture learning from the Planning for Safety project (ROTH 
pathway) for the purpose of informing DfE's policy development. Durham 
University will continue to work with the 4 local authorities in the ROTH pilot 
until the end of the Planning for Safety project (end of December 2023) and,

 protect and support  to enhance the safety of victims and the support that they receive
 pursue and deter  to provide an effective response to perpetrators from initial agency response through to conviction and management of offenders, including rehabilitation
 improve performance  to drive consistency and better performance in the response to domestic abuse across all local areas, agencies and sectors.
22/23 funding is for the project to continue analysing initial and timely police learning from national domestic homicides. This area represents a significant national gap with no method currently to accurately report on the number or nature of domestic homicides and enable early learning to be captured, disseminated to multiple agencies to be acted on rapidly. This funding will allow time critical information to be used to support the safeguarding of high-risk victims of domestic abuse and potential domestic homicide.

The project will enable focussed practice mapping (identifying and promoting promising practice / innovation) to satisfy local and national demand regarding DA and enable improved responses. The Project will continue to develop and maintain a national policing repository of domestic homicide and victim suicide deaths in England and Wales to improve national reporting and enable quick-time learning for police and policy-makers to help prevent future deaths.""",250000.00,2020-04-01,2025-03-31,General Grant - Uncompeted,60,General public services,"Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004"

We have made real progress towards improving our support to victims, including by introducing a new offence of domestic abuse and one for failing to protect a girl from Female Genital Mutilation (FGM); created two new stalking offences; criminalised forced marriage; introduced lifelong anonymity for victims of forced marriage and FGM; and introduced a new mandatory reporting duty on FGM.

However, there is more we need to do to truly tackle this crime and combat more emerging and less well understood variant of it. The scale of Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) is vast: approximately 700,000 people aged 16 to 59 were victims of a sexual assault in the year ending March 2018. In the UK, 1 in 4 women will experience domestic abuse and 1 in 5 sexual assault during their lifetime

That is why this government has publicly committed to publishing a new Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) strategy this Summer that will align our response to the 21st century threats we now face. To inform this strategy, the Home Office launched a high-profile VAWG Call for Evidence which received over 180,000 responses from victims, survivors, members of the public, the sector and academics. These responses will ensure we can put victims at the heart of our response, and we have set aside funding for delivery of VAWG commitments that will be published in our new VAWG strategy for later this year.

We will also be publishing a new Domestic Abuse strategy later this year that will sit alongside the VAWG strategy and help deliver a truly comprehensive response to crimes that disproportionately affect women and girls.

As part of our commitment to combat VAWG, the HO currently funds seven helplines to provide advice and support to female, male, and LGBT victims of domestic abuse, victims of stalking, victims of so called honour-based abuse and perpetrators of domestic abuse.

The purpose of the project is to fund accessible advice/support services for victims of domestic violence and abuse, and specialist support for other victims.

The funding will enable local areas to build on existing work and look to expand multi-agency partnership working in the local areas to drive sustained health- and crime-related outcomes; and help to inform the evidence base for future Government intervention and national investment in this field.

Over a period of two years, the project will aim to start to deliver reductions in: 
 the rate of drug-related deaths;  
 drug-related offending; 
 prevalence of drug use.
ADDER accelerator areas will realise the programme aims by working together to achieve the following outcomes:
 Reduced likelihood of drug-related deaths;
 A reduction in drug related reoffending amongst prolific offenders within local areas;
 Increase in the numbers of drug users engaging in treatment as well as increases in those achieving and sustaining recovery;
 Increase in the number of people moving into paid employment from drug treatment services; 
 A reduction in drug supply within pilot areas;
 Reduced costs for local health services and police forces due to lower health and crime harms, and lower costs to the criminal justice system (as fewer people are dealt with by the courts);
 Increase in number of young and vulnerable people safeguarded.
This would be delivered through the following outputs:   
 Developing a whole-system approach between enforcement, treatment and local authority partners within your local area 
 Enhanced co-ordinated law enforcement activity targeting drug dealers and users.
 Increased use of diversionary interventions to use the criminal justice system to divert users away from offending

Home Office,Home Office,G2-SCH-2021-09-8703,Testing Non-Talking Therapies for Child Victims," The Home Office is seeking approval to spend £93,000 to establish a grant for Barnardos to test non-talking, creative therapies with children in their care who have experienced modern slavery. 
 The grant will test new concepts that arent currently available through the NRM and ICTG Service  ran by Barnardos  to see how effective they are in improving a childs mental health and sleep. 
 This grant will focus on children. Trauma in children can often resurface in sleep, causing nightmares and disturbed nights; sleep is essential to a childs ability to recover and build their resilience. Barnardos states that most of the children they have worked with in the ICTG Service have been affected by poor sleep and it is one of the areas affected most by traumatic journeys.
  Will be delivered through a Direct Grant Award. It is the most appropriate option to utilise the funding available within the timeframe set instead of running an open competition because Barnardos is a proven, trusted supplier of the Home Office and the current support provider for the ICTG service which provides independent advocacy for child victims of modern slavery. Providing the grant in this way will ensure consistency in a childs support and will allow for minimal disruption to their recovery, ensuring their trauma is not amplified.

Home Office,Home Office,G2-SCH-2021-09-8708,Combating Corruption and Organised Crime in the Western Balkans through Strengthening Regional Cooperation in Asset Recovery,"This project is aligned with the key priorities identified in the Integrated Review recently published by the UK Government. The project is aligned and it compliments other initiatives led or supported by the UK Government (i.e. HMRC activities in the region; Anti-corruption Road map; UNODC Asset Recovery Western Balkans project). In order to encourage coordination between initiatives and explore possible cooperation, the AIRE centre will initiate a meeting of key implementers at the project inception, and propose a framework for coordination at regular intervals.     
The key benefit that the project brings is its regional element, so as such it complements all the major national initiatives in the same field (with budgets of over 1 million EUR per country for EU funds) by networking practitioners, facilitating flow of good practice, improving cross-border cooperation and sharing best expertise from the UK.
Beyond cementing cooperation with UNODC, this project will also explore, in conjunction with the SOC programme team and UK partners in the region, creating a steering board to bring together HMRC, UNODC, AIRE, and other interested stakeholders to help ensure UK efforts in this area add up to more of the sum of their parts.",484220.00,2021-04-01,2024-03-31,General Grant - Uncompeted,36,Public order and safety,International Development Act 2002
